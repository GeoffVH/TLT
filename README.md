The Last Throne is a single player node-based wargame with RPG and lite grand-stratagy elements.
The game is built to give players a sense of personal connection to their army leaders and a feeling of grand scale stratagy: leading their faction from pushover to world shaker. 

Currently, the core gameplay is being developed and tested.
