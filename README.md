A Unity hobby project.


The Last Throne is a node-based wargame with RPG and lite grand stratagy elements.
The game is built to give a player a sense of personal connection to their army leaders and a feeling of grand scale progress: leading their faction from pushover to world shaker. 

Currently, the core gameplay is being developed and tested.
