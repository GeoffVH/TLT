how do we pass data from the unit to the combat manager? 

Who knows when the camera is in position?
-Not the camera manager
-Not the unit
-Only the combat manager knows when it put the camera in position. 
    -But the combat manager doesn't know anything about the unit. 


Unit sends it's junk to combat manager right before the camera calls to move?
Then the combat manager has all the unit's ID by the time the camera rolls in. 

We have sucessfully added a solid trigger to the unit. Now, we need to make sure that the pause feature works as needed. 
The problem is what happens if units reach the point at exactly the same time? 

There's a bug where moving three units onto the node does not trigger three seperate combat moments. 
Having the units give their orders based on if they arrived or not may have problems when moving more than one unit. 
And we will want multi-unit movements using card plays. 

We have onselected hold the full list of units. Maybe use that to go through units turn by turn? 
Maybe look further into the game and see how multiple units can reach the same point at the same time. 
Possibly vary the unit's speeds using a weighted randomizer?
    -> Significantly reduces the chance units run into the node at the same exact time. 
    -> But does not completely eliminate it. There might still be a single possible edge case where units do slip together.
    -> And players would absolutely hate that. 
    -> So while this is an easy way out, it's not a solid way out. 

    -> Further testing finds this very, very difficult to replicate without even modifying movespeed.
    -> Perhaps it might be a solution?
    -> No this is dumb. I'm not going to hazard even a 1 in a billion chance of disapointing a player by having their unit skip a turn. 
    
    -> We could store a list of gameobjects and have it go a first in last out setup. 
        -> So combat manager stores gameobjects. each time the camera is ready to roll, it grabs one of those and plays it.
        -> Once it's played, it's removed from the list. 
        -> We could even have the combat itself triggered only if the list has a size > 0.

Problem is that each unit triggers combat. 
But combat is setup to be resolved as a group. 
Which means that moving three units into the fight triggers each unit before the combat is resolved. 
It's a wonder that hasn't crashed. 

I need to find a way to trigger combat as a group. 
The only place where the player selects once is on the onselected script. 
Maybe I should have it hook up a check for combat. 

This did not work. Not at all. The list idea is good, but the trigger needs to be fired only once. 
We can revisit that later. 

At the moment, I think it's not possible for a unit to reach their target at the same exact nano-second as another. 
It might be better to keep the setup as is for now.
