Overview of the current architecture. 

Movement:

When a unit is selected, OnSelect will keep track of that unit. 
On being moved, OnSelect will call up the unit's movement script. 
Movement will wait until the unit arrives at the node and notifies the unit it can begin a check for combat. 

Combat:
A check for combat is triggered each time a unit walks onto a node. This is started with the ArriveAt() function in UnitCore.
ArriveAt() will check the newly entered node to see if there are opposing units. 
If there are, this unit will add itself to the list of units that the combat controller needs to cycle through.
Additionally, the CombatCameraController's OnCombatStart() function is activated. 

The CombatCameraController is activated by OnCombatStart()
It will pause the game, turn off other camera scripts and move the camera to face the node. 
Once the camera is in position, it will trigger a unity event to alert the CombatMainController that the camera is ready.

The CombatMainController listens for this trigger, and runs OnCombatStart()
The combat controller will pop out the last unit added to it's list of units it needs to handle. 
It will wait .5 seconds, during which animation will be added to showcase the attacking unit using a tactic. 
After that, it will resolve combat. 

Combat is resolved by requesting the unit to return a targetting package. 
This package contains a list of targets, and a selected tactic to be used. 
The selected tactic will be called to work and sent information it needs to resolve all calculations. 

Another .5 seconds will pass, during which the defending unit will play it's animation. 
After, the camera controller will be tasked to return the camera to it's original spot. 


TODO:
This is very non-modular and needs to be split up further. As it stands very few of these functions can be tested without
having other modules present to test with. 

The goal is to have a setup where unexpected additions can be easily filled into the setup. 
The real problem is the timing functions. Certain things need to be executed only when certain conditions are met.
